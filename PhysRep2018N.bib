abstract = {It is urgently aimed in prenatal medicine to identify pregnancies, which develop life-threatening preeclampsia prior to the manifestation of the disease. Here, we use recurrence-based methods to distinguish such pregnancies already in the second trimester, using the following cardiovascular time series: the variability of heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. We perform recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), in addition to a novel approach, $\epsilon$-recurrence networks, applied to a phase space constructed by means of these time series. We examine all possible coupling structures in a phase space constructed with the above-mentioned biosignals. Several measures including recurrence rate, determinism, laminarity, trapping time, and longest diagonal and vertical lines for the recurrence quantification analysis and average path length, mean coreness, global clustering coefficient, assortativity, and scale local transitivity dimension for the network measures are considered as parameters for our analysis. With these quantities, we perform a quadratic discriminant analysis that allows us to classify healthy pregnancies and upcoming preeclamptic patients with a sensitivity of 91.7{\%} and a specificity of 45.8{\%} in the case of RQA and 91.7{\%} and 68{\%} when using $\epsilon$-recurrence networks, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {An isovist, or viewshed, is the area in a spatial environment directly visible from a location within the space. Here we show how a set of isovists can be used to generate a graph of mutual visibility between locations. We demonstrate that this graph can also be constructed without reference to isovists and that we are in fact invoking the more general concept of a visibility graph. Using the visibility graph, we can extend both isovist and current graph-based analyses of architectural space to form a new methodology for the investigation of configurational relationships. The measurement of local and global characteristics of the graph, for each vertex or for the system as a whole, is of interest from an architectural perspective, allowing us to describe a configuration with reference to accessibility and visibility, to compare from location to location within a system, and to compare systems with different geometries. Finally we show that visibility graph properties may be closely related to manifestations of spatial perception, such as way-finding, movement, and space use.},

abstract = {Complex network approaches have been recently developed as an alternative framework to study the statistical features of time-series data. We perform a visibility-graph analysis on both the daily and monthly sunspot series. Based on the data, we propose two ways to construct the network: one is from the original observable measurements and the other is from a negative-inverse-transformed series. The degree distribution of the derived networks for the strong maxima has clear non-Gaussian properties, while the degree distribution for minima is bimodal. The long-term variation of the cycles is reflected by hubs in the network that span relatively large time intervals. Based on standard network structural measures, we propose to characterize the long-term correlations by waiting times between two subsequent events. The persistence range of the solar cycles has been identified over 15–1000 days by a power-law regime with scaling exponent $\gamma$ = 2.04 of the occurrence time of two subsequent strong minima. In contrast, a persistent trend is not present in the maximal numbers, although maxima do have significant deviations from an exponential form. Our results suggest some new insights for evaluating existing models.},

@article{Bradley2015c,
abstract = {In 1980 and 1981, two pioneering papers laid the foundation for what became known as nonlinear time-series analysis: the analysis of observed data---typically univariate---via dynamical systems theory. Based on the concept of state-space reconstruction, this set of methods allows us to compute characteristic quantities such as Lyapunov exponents and fractal dimensions, to predict the future course of the time series, and even to reconstruct the equations of motion in some cases. In practice, however, there are a number of issues that restrict the power of this approach: whether the signal accurately and thoroughly samples the dynamics, for instance, and whether it contains noise. Moreover, the numerical algorithms that we use to instantiate these ideas are not perfect; they involve approximations, scale parameters, and finite-precision arithmetic, among other things. Even so, nonlinear time-series analysis has been used to great advantage on thousands of real and synthetic data sets from a wide variety of systems ranging from roulette wheels to lasers to the human heart. Even in cases where the data do not meet the mathematical or algorithmic requirements to assure full topological conjugacy, the results of nonlinear time-series analysis can be helpful in understanding, characterizing, and predicting dynamical systems.},

@article{Holme2012,
abstract = {A great variety of systems in nature, society and technology -- from the web of sexual contacts to the Internet, from the nervous system to power grids -- can be modeled as graphs of vertices coupled by edges. The network structure, describing how the graph is wired, helps us understand, predict and optimize the behavior of dynamical systems. In many cases, however, the edges are not continuously active. As an example, in networks of communication via email, text messages, or phone calls, edges represent sequences of instantaneous or practically instantaneous contacts. In some cases, edges are active for non-negligible periods of time: e.g., the proximity patterns of inpatients at hospitals can be represented by a graph where an edge between two individuals is on throughout the time they are at the same ward. Like network topology, the temporal structure of edge activations can affect dynamics of systems interacting through the network, from disease contagion on the network of patients to information diffusion over an e-mail network. In this review, we present the emergent field of temporal networks, and discuss methods for analyzing topological and temporal structure and models for elucidating their relation to the behavior of dynamical systems. In the light of traditional network theory, one can see this framework as moving the information of when things happen from the dynamical system on the network, to the network itself. Since fundamental properties, such as the transitivity of edges, do not necessarily hold in temporal networks, many of these methods need to be quite different from those for static networks.},

Depending on the specific aspect to be focused on, the correct method has to be employed. This chapter presents an overview of the most advanced and robust statistical methodologies used to describe the properties of seismic time series. Fractal, informational and topological methods emphasize different features of the same seismic phenomenon that are necessary to reveal a deep understanding of seismic time fluctuations. The fractal methods are based on the concept of self-similarity of the seismic phenomenon and are used to identify and quantify correlation properties; the informational methods permit highlighting the organization or order of a seismic time series; the visibility graph method allows converting a seismic sequence in a graph with several topological properties that furnish a nonstandard description of the seismic phenomenon. The integration of all these methods would be useful to get a deeper and multiperspective picture of a seismic process.},

A high degree of similarity is observed on the local and mesoscopic topological scales for surface air temperature fields taken from AOGCM and reanalysis data sets.

High-performance automatic detection method of epilepsy can reduce the workload of medical workers clinically, which has important clinical research significance. In this paper, we propose a new epileptic seizure detection method based on the statistic fusion feature of complex network. Firstly, we convert electroencephalogram (EEG) signals into complex network using horizontal visibility graph and weighted horizontal visibility graph. Then, we extract the average degree square and average weighted degree of complex network. Finally, the weighted sum of this two features is calculated as a single dimensional feature to classify the epileptic EEG signals. Experimental results show that the classification accuracy based on the feature fusion is up to 99{\%}. It indicates that the classification accuracy of the single feature based on feature fusion is very high and the proposed method is effective to classify EEG signals.},

abstract = {Several methods exist to construct complex networks from time series. In general, these methods claim to construct complex networks that preserve certain properties of the underlying dynamical system, and hence, they mark new ways of accessing quantitative indicators based on that dynamics. In this paper, we test this assertion by developing an algorithm to realize dynamical systems from these complex networks in such a way that trajectories of these dynamical systems produce time series that preserve certain statistical properties of the original time series (and hence, also the underlying true dynamical system). Trajectories from these networks are constructed from only the information in the network and are shown to be statistically equivalent to the original time series. In the context of this algorithm, we are able to demonstrate that the so-called adaptive k-nearest neighbour algorithm for generating networks out-performs methods based on -ball recurrence plots. For such networks, and with a suitable choice of parameter values, which we provide, the time series generated by this method function as a new kind of nonlinear surrogate generation algorithm. With this approach, we are able to test whether the simulation dynamics built from a complex network capture the underlying structure of the original system; whether the complex network is an adequate model of the dynamics.},

Thus, it is important to understand not only the dynamics of individual time series but also their interactions. Although there are many methods for analysing the interaction between two or more time series, there are very few methods that describe global changes of the interactions over time. Here, we propose an approach to visualise time evolution for the global changes of the interactions in complex systems. This approach consists of two steps. In the first step, we construct a meta-time series of networks. In the second step, we analyse and visualise this meta-time series by using distance and recurrence plots. Our two-step approach involving intermediate network representations elucidates the half-a-day periodicity of foreign exchange markets and a singular functional network in the brain related to perceptual alternations.},

We have recently shown [B. Luque et al., PLoS ONE 6, 9 (2011)] that dynamical systems can be studied from a novel perspective via the use of this method. Specifically, the period-doubling and band-splitting attractor cascades that characterize unimodal maps transform into families of graphs that turn out to be independent of map nonlinearity or other particulars. Here, we provide an in depth description of the HV treatment of the Feigenbaum scenario, together with analytical derivations that relate to the degree distributions, mean distances, clustering coefficients, etc., associated to the bifurcation cascades and their accumulation points. We describe how the resultant families of graphs can be framed into a renormalization group scheme in which fixed-point graphs reveal their scaling properties. These fixed points are then re-derived from an entropy optimization process defined for the graph sets, confirming a suggested connection between renormalization group and entropy optimization. Finally, we provide analytical and numerical results for the graph entropy and show that it emulates the Lyapunov exponent of the map independently of its sign.},

abstract = {Visibility algorithms transform time series into graphs and encode dynamical information in their topology, paving the way for graph-theoretical time series analysis as well as building a bridge between nonlinear dynamics and network science. In this work we introduce and study the concept of sequential visibility graph motifs, smaller substructures of n consecutive nodes that appear with characteristic frequencies. We develop a theory to compute in an exact way the motif profiles associated to general classes of deterministic and stochastic dynamics. We find that this simple property is indeed a highly informative and computationally efficient feature capable to distinguish among different dynamics and robust against noise contamination. We finally confirm that it can be used in practice to perform unsupervised learning, by extracting motif profiles from experimental heart-rate series and being able, accordingly, to disentangle meditative from other relaxation states. Applications of this general theory include the automatic classification and description of physical, biological, and financial time series.},

abstract = {A growing number of algorithms have been proposed to map a scalar time series into ordinal partition transition networks. However, most observable phenomena in the empirical sciences are of a multivariate nature. We construct ordinal partition transition networks for multivariate time series. This approach yields weighted directed networks representing the pattern transition properties of time series in velocity space, which hence provides dynamic insights of the underling system. Furthermore, we propose a measure of entropy to characterize ordinal partition transition dynamics, which is sensitive to capturing the possible local geometric changes of phase space trajectories. We demonstrate the applicability of pattern transition networks to capture phase coherence to non-coherence transitions, and to characterize paths to phase synchronizations. Therefore, we conclude that the ordinal partition transition network approach provides complementary insight to the traditional symbolic analysis of nonlinear multivariate time series.},

abstract = {Recurrence in the phase space of complex systems is a well-studied phenomenon, which has provided deep insights into the nonlinear dynamics of such systems. For dissipative systems, characteristics based on recurrence plots have recently attracted much interest for discriminating qualitatively different types of dynamics in terms of measures of complexity, dynamical invariants, or even structural characteristics of the underlying attractor's geometry in phase space. Here, we demonstrate that the latter approach also provides a corresponding distinction between different co-existing dynamical regimes of the standard map, a paradigmatic example of a low-dimensional conservative system. Specifically, we show that the recently developed approach of recurrence network analysis provides potentially useful geometric characteristics distinguishing between regular and chaotic orbits. We find that chaotic orbits in an intermittent laminar phase (commonly referred to as sticky orbits) have a distinct geometric structure possibly differing in a subtle way from those of regular orbits, which is highlighted by different recurrence network properties obtained from relatively short time series. Thus, this approach can help discriminating regular orbits from laminar phases of chaotic ones, which presents a persistent challenge to many existing chaos detection techniques.},

By mapping daily time series from 141 different stations of 53 Brazilian rivers into complex networks, we present a useful approach for investigating the dynamics of river flows. We verified that the degree distributions of these networks were well described by exponential functions, where the characteristic exponents are almost always larger than the value obtained for random time series. The faster-than-random decay of the degree distributions is an another evidence that the fluctuation dynamics underlying the river discharges has a long-range correlated nature. We further investigated the evolution of the river discharges by tracking the values of the characteristic exponents (of the degree distribution) and the global clustering coefficients of the networks over the years. We show that the river discharges in several stations have evolved to become more or less correlated (and displaying more or less complex internal network structures) over the years, a behavior that could be related to changes in the climate system and other man-made phenomena.},

As the main result of this paper, a technique for the computation of recurrence quantitative analysis (RQA) is outlined. This method significantly reduces spatial complexity of computation by computing RQA directly from the time series, optimizing memory accesses and reducing computational time. Additionally, parallel implementation of this technique is tested on the Salomon cluster and is proved to be extremely fast and scalable. This means that recurrence quantitative analysis may be applied to longer time series or in applications with the need of real-time analysis.},

In this study, we investigate multifractal properties of connectivity time series resulting from the visibility graph applied to normally distributed time series generated by the Ito equations with multiplicative power-law noise. We show that multifractality of the connectivity time series (i.e., the series of numbers of links outgoing any node) increases with the exponent of the power-law noise. The multifractality of the connectivity time series could be due to the width of connectivity degree distribution that can be related to the exit time of the associated Ito time series. Furthermore, the connectivity time series are characterized by persistence, although the original Ito time series are random; this is due to the procedure of visibility graph that, connecting the values of the time series, generates persistence but destroys most of the nonlinear correlations. Moreover, the visibility graph is sensitive for detecting wide "depressions" in input time series.},

abstract = {We propose a method to measure real-valued time series irreversibility which combines two differ- ent tools: the horizontal visibility algorithm and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This method maps a time series to a directed network according to a geometric criterion. The degree of irreversibility of the series is then estimated by the Kullback-Leibler divergence (i.e. the distinguishability) between the in and out degree distributions of the associated graph. The method is computationally effi- cient, does not require any ad hoc symbolization process, and naturally takes into account multiple scales. We find that the method correctly distinguishes between reversible and irreversible station- ary time series, including analytical and numerical studies of its performance for: (i) reversible stochastic processes (uncorrelated and Gaussian linearly correlated), (ii) irreversible stochastic pro- cesses (a discrete flashing ratchet in an asymmetric potential), (iii) reversible (conservative) and irreversible (dissipative) chaotic maps, and (iv) dissipative chaotic maps in the presence of noise. Two alternative graph functionals, the degree and the degree-degree distributions, can be used as the Kullback-Leibler divergence argument. The former is simpler and more intuitive and can be used as a benchmark, but in the case of an irreversible process with null net current, the degree-degree distribution has to be considered to identifiy the irreversible nature of the series.},

A detailed numerical analysis is performed for the chaotic Rössler system, which displays both types of chaos as one control parameter is varied, and the Mackey-Glass system as an example of a time-delay system with noncoherent chaos. Our results demonstrate that especially geometric measures from recurrence network analysis are well suited for tracing transitions between spiral- and screw-type chaos, a common route from phase-coherent to noncoherent chaos also found in other nonlinear oscillators.

@incollection{Luque2016,
abstract = {In this chapter, we concentrate on a mapping from time series to graphs, the visibility algorithm introduced by Lacasa et al. [1]. In order to cite some of its most relevant features, we will stress its intrinsic nonlocality, low computational cost, straightforward implementation, and quite " simple " way of inheriting the time series properties in the structure of the associated graphs. These features will make it easier to find connections between the underlying processes and the networks obtained from them by a direct analysis of the latter. In particular, in this chapter, we will focus the implementation of the algorithm of visibility to three known routes to chaos. We will define a graph entropy and process of renormalization for visibility graphs that characterize these routes and analyze the relationship between the flow of renormalization and the extremes of the entropy function. Disregarding any underlying process, we can consider a time series just as an ordered set of values and transform this set into a different mathematical object with the aids of an abstract mapping [2, 3]. We can then ask which properties of the original set are conserved, which are transformed and how, what can we say about one of the mathematical representations just by looking at the other. This exercise is of mathematical interest by itself. In addition, it turns out that time series or signals is a universal method of extracting information from dynamical systems in any field of science. Therefore, the preceding mathematical mapping gains some unexpected practical interest as it opens the possibility of analyzing a time series from an alternative point of view. Of course, the relevant information stored in the original time series should be somehow conserved in the mapping. The motivation is completed when the new representation belongs to a relatively mature mathematical field, where information encoded in such a representation can be effectively disentangled and processed. This is, precisely, the first motiva-tion to map time series into networks. This motivation is increased by two interconnected factors: (i) Although a mature field, time series analysis has some limitations, when it refers to study the so-called complex signals. Beyond the linear regime, there exists a wide range of phenomena, which are usually embraced in the field of the so-called complex systems. Dynamical phenomena such as chaos, long-range correlated stochastic processes, intermittency, and multifractality are examples of complex phenomena, where time series analysis is pushed to its own limits. Nonlinear time series analysis develops from techniques such as nonlinear correlation functions, embedding algorithms, multrifractal spectra, and projection theorem tools that increase in complexity parallel to the complexity of the process/series under study. New approaches to deal with complexity are not only welcome, but needed. Approaches dealing with the intrinsic nonlinearity by being intrinsically nonlinear in turn deal with the possible multiscale character of the underlying process by being designed to naturally incorporated multiple scales, and such is the framework of networks, of graph theory. (ii) The technological era brings us the possibility to digitally analyze myriads of data in a glimpse. Massive data sets can nowadays be parsed, and with the aid of well-suited algorithms, we can gain access and filter data from many processes, let it be of physical, technological, or even social garment.},

In the model, the nodes in the network are represented by the traffic flow states, the links in the network are represented by the transform of the traffic flow states, and the traffic flow transported when performing the transform of the traffic flow states is considered as the weight of the link. Several topological features of this generalized weighted model, such as the degree distribution and strength distribution, have been numerically studied. A scaling behavior between the strength and degree s ∼ k log k is obtained.

@article{Yang2013,
abstract = {With the rapid technological advancement, network is almost everywhere in our daily life. Network theory leads to a new way to investigate the dynamics of complex systems. As a result, many methods are proposed to construct a network from nonlinear time series, including the partition of state space, visibility graph, nearest neighbors, and recurrence approaches. However, most previous works focus on deriving the adjacency matrix to represent the complex network and extract new network-theoretic measures. Although the adjacency matrix provides connectivity information of nodes and edges, the network geometry can take variable forms. The research objective of this article is to develop a self-organizing approach to derive the steady geometric structure of a network from the adjacency matrix. We simulate the recurrence network as a physical system by treating the edges as springs and the nodes as electrically charged particles. Then, force-directed algorithms are developed to automatically organize the network geometry by minimizing the system energy. Further, a set of experiments were designed to investigate important factors (i.e., dynamical systems, network construction methods, force-model parameter, nonhomogeneous distribution) affecting this self-organizing process. Interestingly, experimental results show that the self-organized geometry recovers the attractor of a dynamical system that produced the adjacency matrix. This research addresses a question, i.e., "what is the self-organizing geometry of a recurrence network?" and provides a new way to reproduce the attractor or time series from the recurrence plot. As a result, novel network-theoretic measures (e.g., average path length and proximity ratio) can be achieved based on actual node-to-node distances in the self-organized network topology. The paper brings the physical models into the recurrence analysis and discloses the spatial geometry of recurrence networks.},

During the last years, intensive efforts have been spent on applying network-based concepts also for the analysis of dynamically relevant higher-order statistical properties of time series. Notably, many corresponding approaches are closely related with the concept of recurrence in phase space. In this paper, we review recent methodological advances in time series analysis based on complex networks, with a special emphasis on methods founded on recurrence plots. The potentials and limitations of the individual methods are discussed and illustrated for paradigmatic examples of dynamical systems as well as for real-world time series. Complex network measures are shown to provide information about structural features of dynamical systems that are complementary to those characterized by other methods of time series analysis and, hence, substantially enrich the knowledge gathered from other existing (linear as well as nonlinear) approaches.},

abstract = {The visibility algorithm has been recently introduced as a mapping between time series and complex networks. This procedure allows to apply methods of complex network theory for characterizing time series. In this work we present the horizontal visibility algorithm, a geometrically simpler and analytically solvable version of our former algorithm, focusing on the mapping of random series (series of independent identically distributed random variables). After presenting some properties of the algorithm, we present exact results on the topological properties of graphs associated to random series, namely the degree distribution, clustering coefficient, and mean path length. We show that the horizontal visibility algorithm stands as a simple method to discriminate randomness in time series, since any random series maps to a graph with an exponential degree distribution of the shape P(k) = (1/3)(2/3)**(k-2), independently of the probability distribution from which the series was generated. Accordingly, visibility graphs with other P(k) are related to non-random series. Numerical simulations confirm the accuracy of the theorems for finite series. In a second part, we show that the method is able to distinguish chaotic series from i.i.d. theory, studying the following situations: (i) noise-free low-dimensional chaotic series, (ii) low-dimensional noisy chaotic series, even in the presence of large amounts of noise, and (iii) high-dimensional chaotic series (coupled map lattice), without needs for additional techniques such as surrogate data or noise reduction methods. Finally, heuristic arguments are given to explain the topological properties of chaotic series and several sequences which are conjectured to be random are analyzed.},

By using the Lorenz system and real data, we demonstrate that the global clustering coefficient is robust to the embedding parameters. We applied this approach to study skin BFO at baseline and during loading pressure, a causative factor of skin breakdown. The results showed that global clustering coefficients of BFO significantly decreased in response to loading ( {\&}{\#}60;0.05). Moreover, surrogate tests indicated that such a decrease was associated with a loss of nonlinearity of BFO. Our results suggest that the recurrence network approach can practically quantify the nonlinear dynamics of BFO.},

A universal allometric scaling law is uncovered in the minimal spanning trees, whose scaling exponent is independent of the stock market and the length of the stock index. In contrast, the maximal spanning trees and the random spanning trees do not exhibit universal allometric scaling behaviors. There are marked discrepancies in the allometric scaling behaviors between the stock indices and the Brownian motions. Using surrogate time series, we find that these discrepancies are caused by the fat-tailedness of the return distribution, the nonlinear long-term correlation, and a coupling effect between these two influence factors.},

While for discrete systems, a discrimination between periodic and chaotic windows can be easily made based on the maximum Lyapunov exponent of the system, this remains a challenging task for continuous systems, especially if only short time series are available (e.g., in case of experimental data). In this work, we demonstrate that nonlinear measures based on recurrence plots obtained from such trajectories provide a practicable alternative for numerically detecting shrimps. Traditional diagonal line-based measures of recurrence quantification analysis as well as measures from complex network theory are shown to allow an excellent classification of periodic and chaotic behavior in parameter space. Using the well-studied R?ssler system as a benchmark example, we find that the average path length and the clustering coefficient of the resulting recurrence networks are particularly powerful discriminatory statistics for the identification of complex periodic windows.},

abstract = {We present a model of complex network generated from Hang Seng index (HSI) of Hong Kong stock market, which encodes stock market relevant both interconnections and interactions between fluctuation patterns of HSI in the network topologies. In the network, the nodes (edges) represent all kinds of patterns of HSI fluctuation (their interconnections). Based on network topological statistic, we present efficient algorithms, measuring betweenness centrality (BC) and inverse participation ratio (IPR) of network adjacency matrix, for detecting topological important nodes. We have at least obtained three uniform nodes of topological importance, and find the three nodes, i.e. 18.7{\%} nodes undertake 71.9{\%} betweenness centrality and closely correlate other nodes. From these topological important nodes, we can extract hidden significant fluctuation patterns of HSI. We also find these patterns are independent the time intervals scales. The results contain important physical implication, i.e. the significant patterns play much more important roles in both information control and transport of stock market, and should be useful for us to more understand fluctuations regularity of stock market index. Moreover, we could conclude that Hong Kong stock market, rather than a random system, is statistically stable, by comparison to random networks. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Phase-space trajectories of synchronous electroencephalogram signals were obtained through embedding dimension in phase-space reconstruction based on the distance set of space points. The recurrence matrix calculated from phase-space trajectories was identified with the adjacency matrix of a complex network. Then, we applied measures to characterize the complex network to this recurrence network. A detailed analysis revealed the following: (1) The recurrence networks of normal brains exhibited a sparser connectivity and smaller clustering coefficient compared with that of epileptic brains; (2) the small-world property existed in both normal and epileptic brains consistent with the previous empirical studies of structural and functional brain networks; and (3) the assortative property of the recurrence network was found by computing the assortative coefficients; their values increased from normal to epileptic brain which accurately suggested the difference of the states. These universal and non-universal characteristics of recurrence networks might help clearly understand the underlying neurodynamics of the brain and provide an efficient tool for clinical diagnosis.},

abstract = {We investigate a generalised version of the recently proposed ordinal partition time series to network transformation algorithm. First, we introduce a fixed time lag for the elements of each partition that is selected using techniques from traditional time delay embedding. The resulting partitions define regions in the embedding phase space that are mapped to nodes in the network space. Edges are allocated between nodes based on temporal succession thus creating a Markov chain representation of the time series. We then apply this new transformation algorithm to time series generated by the R{\{}{\"{o}}{\}}ssler system and find that periodic dynamics translate to ring structures whereas chaotic time series translate to band or tube-like structures—thereby indicating that our algorithm generates networks whose structure is sensitive to system dynamics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple network measures including the mean out degree and variance of out degrees can track changes in the dynamical behaviour in a manner comparable to the largest Lyapunov exponent. We also apply the same analysis to experimental time series generated by a diode resonator circuit and show that the network size, mean shortest path length, and network diameter are highly sensitive to the interior crisis captured in this particular data set.},

We set them as the ones giving the maximum Shannon entropy for the first simultaneous minima of recurrence rate and Shannon entropy. To identify metastable states, as well as the transitions between them, we use a soft partitioning algorithm for module finding which is specifically developed for the case in which a system shows metastability. We illustrate our method with two complex time series examples. Finally, we show the robustness of our method for identifying metastable states.

Firstly, HVGEs and SaEs are extracted from 1,200 recordings of biomedical signals, respectively. A statistical analysis method is employed to choose the optimal channels to identify the abnormalities in alcoholics. Five group chan-nels are selected and forwarded to a K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) and a support vector machine (SVM) to conduct classification, respectively. The experimental results show that the HVGEs associated with left hemisphere, C1, C3 and FC5 electrodes, of alcoholics are significantly abnor-mal. The accuracy of classification with 10-fold cross-validation is 87.5 {\%} with about three HVGE features. By using just optimal 13-dimension HVGE features, the accuracy is 95.8 {\%}. In contrast, SaE features associated cannot identify the left hemisphere disorder for alcoholism and the maximum classification ratio based on SaE is just 95.2 {\%} even using all channel signals. These results demonstrate that the HVGE method is a promising approach for alcoholism identification by EEG signals.},

In our method, a new support function based on distance is proposed to measure the support degree of each other. The advantage is that the VGPA operator fully takes into account not only the relationship but also the correlation degree between the values. Compared with VGA operator, numerical results show more effectiveness on the proposed operator. Finally, the analysis of the Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX) is used to illustrate the application of the VGPA operator. In addition, the aggregated results compared with other operators show that our proposed method is more reasonable and effective in time series.},

abstract = {For a country that imports crude oil, the forex burden is always fluctuant due to the fluctuation of international crude oil prices and exchange rates over time. The gap discovered between international crude oil prices and the crude oil price based on exchange rates may indicate the fluctuation of the forex burden. There exist different fluctuant patterns in the fluctuation process of the forex burden in different periods. Hence, we proposed an approach combining econometrics and complex network theory to explore the transmission mechanism of these fluctuant patterns. In this study, we defined the forex burden and the fluctuant patterns by normalization, sliding windows of data and econometric models. And then we set the fluctuant patterns as nodes and the transformation between patterns as edges; in this way, the transmission complex network is constructed. The results show that different major fluctuant patterns with different probabilities appear in different scales. The fluctuant patterns transferred into each other conveniently. And the transmission medium can help to identify the transitional periods in the process of the transmission. The contribution of this study to the energy policy decision-making is that the formulations of related policies under different period lengths require different reference standards. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

We illustrate similarities and differences between the recurrence quantification analysis and the complex network analysis. By using the logistic map, we demonstrate the potential of the complex network measures for the detection of different dynamical regimes. Pre-eclampsia in pregnancy is a serious disease with high risk of fetal and maternal morbidity. The usual positive predictive value is 20--30{\%}.

We deduce the exact expressions of mean degree and clustering coefficient, demonstrate the long distance visibility property of the graph and perform numerical simulations to test the accuracy of our theoretical results. We then use the algorithm in several deterministic chaotic series, such as the logistic map, H´enon map, Lorenz system, energy price chaotic system and the real crude oil price.

Here, we define autoregressive patterns quantitatively through an econometrical regression model. We present a computational algorithm that sets the autoregressive patterns as nodes and transmissions between patterns as edges, and then converts the transmission process of autoregressive patterns in a time series into a network. We utilised daily Shanghai (securities) composite index time series to study the transmission characteristics of autoregressive patterns. We found statistically significant evidence that the financial market is not random and that there are similar characteristics between parts and whole time series. A few types of autoregressive sub-patterns and transmission patterns drive the oscillations of the financial market. A clustering effect on fluctuations appears in the transmission process, and certain non-major autoregressive sub-patterns have high media capabilities in the financial time series. Different stock indexes exhibit similar characteristics in the transmission of fluctuation information. This work not only proposes a distinctive perspective for analysing financial time series but also provides important information for investors.},

Inspired by recent effort on using network metrics to characterize time series for classification, we present an approach to visualize time series as complex networks based on the first order Markov process in its temporal ordering. In contrast to the classical bar charts, line plots and other statistics based graph, our approach delivers more intuitive visualization that better preserves both the temporal dependency and frequency structures. It provides a natural inverse operation to map the graph back to time series, making it possible to use graph statistics to characterize time series for better visual exploration and statistical analysis. Our experimental results suggest the effectiveness on various tasks such as system identification, pattern mining and classification on both synthetic and the real time series data.},

abstract = {Signals from heart transplant recipients can be considered to be a natural source of information for a better understanding of the impact of the autonomic nervous system on the complexity of heart rate variability. Beat-to-beat heart rate variability can be represented as a network of increments between subsequent {\$}RR{\$}-intervals, which makes possible the visualization of short-term heart period fluctuations. A network is constructed of vertices representing increments between subsequent {\$}RR{\$}-intervals, and edges which connect adjacent {\$}RR{\$}-increments. Two modes of visualization of such a network are proposed. The method described is applied to nocturnal Holter signals recorded from healthy young people and from cardiac transplant recipients. Additionally, the analysis is performed on surrogate data: shuffled RR-intervals (to display short-range dependence), and shuffled phases of the Fourier Transform of RR-intervals (to filter out linear dependences). Important nonlinear properties of autonomic nocturnal regulation in short-term variability in healthy young persons are associated with {\$}RR{\$}-increments: accelerations and decelerations of a size greater than about 35 ms. They reveal that large accelerations are more likely antipersistent, while large decelerations are more likely persistent. Changes in {\$}RR{\$}-increments in a heart deprived of autonomic supervision are much lower than in a healthy individual, and appear to be maintained around a homeostatic state, but there are indications that this dynamics is nonlinear. The method is fruitful in the evaluation of the vagal activity - the quantity and quality of the vagal tone - during the nocturnal rest of healthy young people. The method also successfully extracts nonlinear effects related to intrinsic mechanisms of the heart regulation.},

abstract = {Two entropy-based approaches are investigated to study patterns describing differences in time intervals between consecutive heartbeats. The first method explores matrices arising from networks of transitions constructed following events represented by a time series. The second method considers distributions of ordinal patterns of length three, whereby patterns with repeated values are counted as different patterns. Both methods provide estimators of dynamical aspects of short-term heartbeat signals obtained from nocturnal Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of healthy people of different ages and genders. The deceleration capacity, arising from the adjacency matrix of the network, and the entropy rate, resulting from the transition matrix of the network, are also calculated, and both significantly decay with aging. As people age, the permutation entropy grows, due to the increase in patterns with repeated values. All of these estimators describe in a consistent way changes in the beat-to-beat heart period dynamics caused by aging. An overall slowing down of heart period changes is observed, and an increase of permutation entropy results from the progressive increase of patterns with repeated values. This result points to the sympathetic drive becoming dominant in cardiac regulation of nocturnal heart rate with age.},

In fact, we are able to identify a small critical range numerically that is approximately the same for the random and several standard chaotic time series for a fixed M. This provides us a uniform framework for the nonsubjective comparison of the statistical measures of the recurrence networks constructed from various chaotic attractors. We explicitly show that the degree distribution of the recurrence network constructed by our scheme is characteristic to the structure of the attractor and display statistical scale invariance with respect to increase in the number of nodes N . We also present two practical applications of the scheme, detection of transition between two dynamical regimes in a time-delayed system and identification of the dimensionality of the underlying system from real-world data with a limited number of points through recurrence network measures. The merits, limitations, and the potential applications of the proposed method are also highlighted.},

abstract = {A growing interest exists currently in the analysis of time series by the complex network theory. Here we present a simple and quick way for mapping time series to complex networks. Using a simple rule allows us to transform time series into a textual sequence then we divide it into words with fixed size. Distinct words are nodes of the network, and we have complete control on the network scale by adjusting the word size. Two nodes are linked if their associated words co-occur in sequence. We show that the network topological measures quantify the persistence and the long range correlations in fractional Brownian processes. For a particular word size we assume some relations between the topological measures and the Hurst exponent which characterised the persistence in fractional Brownian processes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The difference of the recurrence properties between quasiperiodic and chaotic orbits is revisited, which helps to understand the complex patterns of the corresponding RPs. Moreover, several measures from the recurrence quantification analysis are used to quantify these patterns. Among these measures, the recurrence rate, quantifying the percentage of black points in the plot, is applied to characterize the stickiness of a typical chaotic orbit. The advantage of the recurrence based method in comparison to other standard techniques is that it is possible to distinguish between quasiperiodic and chaotic orbits that are temporarily trapped in a sticky domain, from very short trajectories.},

abstract = {A traditional way to quantify synchronous interactions between animals has been to use concordance indices, which commonly do not take into account the effects of the length of the sampling time and of behaviour driven by third parties. We overcame these issues by casting the process of investigating behavioural interactions into a network inference methodology. We summarized multivariate time series using a complex network whose construction depends on a surrogate hypothesis testing data analysis of synchronous interactions between animals. The method accounts for the effect of third parties on pairwise comparisons, allows one to test the effect of the size of the sampling window on the interactions between animals, and allows one to test behavioural models of increasing complexity. We used a continuous 1-month behavioural data set of the foraging activity of a mixed-sex group of 40 Soay sheep, Ovis aries. We uncovered underlying patterns of behavioural interaction between individual sheep by applying our inferential approach to the symbolic multivariate time series of activity, that is grazing, not grazing. Our findings clearly indicate that animals of the same sex are more synchronized than animals of different sex independent of body size. We advocate that the method proposed is more general and more efficient at detecting patterns of synchronization than traditional concordance indices. We provide the reader with a comprehensive software toolbox to apply the methodology proposed. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Our results demonstrate that a cross-clustering coefficient from a multivariate recurrence network is very sensitive to transitions among different flow patterns and recovers quantitative insights into the flow behavior underlying horizontal oil-water flows.

abstract = {In this study, we propose a new information theoretic measure to quantify the complexity of biological systems based on time-series data. We demonstrate the potential of our method using two distinct applications to human cardiac dynamics. Firstly, we show that the method clearly discriminates between segments of electrocardiogram records characterized by normal sinus rhythm, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Secondly, we investigate the multiscale complexity of cardiac dynamics with respect to age in healthy individuals using interbeat interval time series and compare our findings with a previous study which established a link between age and fractal-like long-range correlations. The method we use is an extension of the symbolic mapping procedure originally proposed for permutation entropy. We build a Markov chain of the dynamics based on order patterns in the time series which we call an ordinal network, and from this model compute an intuitive entropic measure of transitional complexity. A discussion of the model parameter space in terms of traditional time delay embedding provides a theoretical basis for our multiscale approach. As an ancillary discussion, we address the practical issue of node aliasing and how this effects ordinal network models of continuous systems from discrete time sampled data, such as interbeat interval time series.This article is part of the themed issue {\{}$\backslash$textquoteleft{\}}Mathematical methods in medicine: neuroscience, cardiology and pathology{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}.},

abstract = {Conformational dynamics of proteins can be interpreted as itinerant motions as the protein traverses from one state to another on a complex network in conformational space or, more generally, in state space. Here we present a scheme to extract a multiscale state space network (SSN) from a single-molecule time series. Analysis by this method enables us to lift degeneracy--different physical states having the same value for a measured observable--as much as possible. A state or node in the network is defined not by the value of the observable at each time but by a set of subsequences of the observable over time. The length of the subsequence can tell us the extent to which the memory of the system is able to predict the next state. As an illustration, we investigate the conformational fluctuation dynamics probed by single-molecule electron transfer (ET), detected on a photon-by-photon basis. We show that the topographical features of the SSNs depend on the time scale of observation; the longer the time scale, the simpler the underlying SSN becomes, leading to a transition of the dynamics from anomalous diffusion to normal Brownian diffusion.},

One efficient way to characterize complex systems is to measure time series and then extract information from the measurements. We propose a reliable method for constructing a multiscale complex network from multivariate time series. In particular, for a given multivariate time series, we first perform a coarse-grained operation to define temporal scales and then reconstruct the multivariate phase-space for each scale to infer multiscale complex networks. In addition, we develop a novel clustering coefficient entropy to assess the derived multiscale complex networks, aiming to characterize the coupled dynamical characteristics underlying multivariate time series. We apply our proposed approach to the analysis of multivariate time series measured from gas-liquid two-phase flow experiments. The results yield novel insights into the inherent coupled flow behavior underlying a realistic multiphase flow system.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Author(s).Thermoacoustic instability and lean blowout are the major challenges faced when a gas turbine combustor is operated under fuel lean conditions. The dynamics of thermoacoustic system is the result of complex nonlinear interactions between the subsystems-turbulent reactive flow and the acoustic field of the combustor. In order to study the transitions between the dynamical regimes in such a complex system, the time series corresponding to one of the dynamic variables is transformed to an ɛ-recurrence network. The topology of the recurrence network resembles the structure of the attractor representing the dynamics of the system. The transitions in the thermoacoustic system are then captured as the variation in the topological characteristics of the network. We show the presence of power law degree distribution in the recurrence networks constructed from time series acquired during the occurrence of combustion noise and during the low amplitude aperiodic oscillations prior to lean blowout. We also show the absence of power law degree distribution in the recurrence networks constructed from time series acquired during the occurrence of thermoacoustic instability and during the occurrence of intermittency. We demonstrate that the measures derived from recurrence network can be used as tools to capture the transitions in the turbulent combustor and also as early warning measures for predicting impending thermoacoustic instability and blowout.},

With the increasing of incidence of epilepsy, automatic epileptic seizure detection with high performance is of great clinical significance. In order to improve the efficiency of epilepsy diagnosis, a novel feature extraction method for epileptic EEG signal based on the statistical property of the complex network and an epileptic seizure detection algorithm, which is composed of the extracted feature and support vector machine (SVM) is proposed. The EEG signal is converted to complex network by horizontal visibility graph firstly. Then the degree centrality of complex network as a novel feature is calculated. At last, the extracted feature and SVM construct automatic epileptic seizure detection. A classification experiment of the epileptic EEG dataset is performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed detection algorithm. Experimental results show the novel feature we extracted can distinguish ictal EEG from interictal EEG clearly and the proposed detection algorithm achieves high classification accuracy which can be up to 93.92 {\%}.},

abstract = {Many studies have shown that additional information can be gained on time series by investigating their associated complex networks. In this work, we investigate the multifractal property and Laplace spectrum of the horizontal visibility graphs (HVGs) constructed from fractional Brownian motions. We aim to identify via simulation and curve fitting the form of these properties in terms of the Hurst index {\$}H{\$}. First, we use the sandbox algorithm to study the multifractality of these HVGs. It is found that multifractality exists in these HVGs. We find that the average fractal dimension {\$}\backslashlangle D(0)\backslashrangle{\$} of HVGs approximately satisfies the prominent linear formula {\$}\backslashlangle D(0)\backslashrangle = 2 - H{\$}; while the average information dimension {\$}\backslashlangle D(1)\backslashrangle{\$} and average correlation dimension {\$}\backslashlangle D(2)\backslashrangle{\$} are all approximately bi-linear functions of {\$}H{\$} when {\$}H\backslashge 0.15{\$}. Then, we calculate the spectrum and energy for the general Laplacian operator and normalized Laplacian operator of these HVGs. We find that, for the general Laplacian operator, the average logarithm of second-smallest eigenvalue {\$}\backslashlangle \backslashln (u{\_}2) \backslashrangle{\$}, the average logarithm of third-smallest eigenvalue {\$}\backslashlangle \backslashln (u{\_}3) \backslashrangle{\$}, and the average logarithm of maximum eigenvalue {\$}\backslashlangle \backslashln (u{\_}n) \backslashrangle{\$} of these HVGs are approximately linear functions of {\$}H{\$}; while the average Laplacian energy {\$}\backslashlangle E{\_}{\{}nL{\}} \backslashrangle{\$} is approximately a quadratic polynomial function of {\$}H{\$}. For the normalized Laplacian operator, {\$}\backslashlangle \backslashln (u{\_}2) \backslashrangle{\$} and {\$}\backslashlangle \backslashln (u{\_}3) \backslashrangle{\$} of these HVGs approximately satisfy linear functions of {\$}H{\$}; while {\$}\backslashlangle \backslashln (u{\_}n) \backslashrangle{\$} and {\$}\backslashlangle E{\_}{\{}nL{\}} \backslashrangle{\$} are approximately a 4th and cubic polynomial function of {\$}H{\$} respectively.},

abstract = {The problem of aggregation is of considerable importance in many disciplines. In this paper, a new type of operator called visibility graph averaging (VGA) aggregation operator is proposed. This proposed operator is based on the visibility graph which can convert a time series into a graph. The weights are obtained according to the importance of the data in the visibility graph. Finally, the VGA operator is used in the analysis of the TAIEX database to illustrate that it is practical and compared with the classic aggregation operators, it shows its advantage that it not only implements the aggregation of the data purely, but also conserves the time information. Meanwhile, the determination of the weights is more reasonable. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recurrence networks are a powerful nonlinear tool for time series analysis of complex dynamical systems. While there are already many successful applications ranging from medicine to paleoclimatology, a solid theoretical foundation of the method has still been missing so far. Here, we interpret an ɛ-recurrence network as a discrete subnetwork of a "continuous" graph with uncountably many vertices and edges corresponding to the system's attractor. This step allows us to show that various statistical measures commonly used in complex network analysis can be seen as discrete estimators of newly defined continuous measures of certain complex geometric properties of the attractor on the scale given by ɛ. In particular, we introduce local measures such as the ɛ-clustering coefficient, mesoscopic measures such as ɛ-motif density, path-based measures such as ɛ-betweennesses, and global measures such as ɛ-efficiency. This new analytical basis for the so far heuristically motivated network measures also provides an objective criterion for the choice of ɛ via a percolation threshold, and it shows that estimation can be improved by so-called node splitting invariant versions of the measures. We finally illustrate the framework for a number of archetypical chaotic attractors such as those of the Bernoulli and logistic maps, periodic and two-dimensional quasiperiodic motions, and for hyperballs and hypercubes by deriving analytical expressions for the novel measures and comparing them with data from numerical experiments. More generally, the theoretical framework put forward in this work describes random geometric graphs and other networks with spatial constraints, which appear frequently in disciplines ranging from biology to climate science.},

abstract = {Usual techniques for electroencephalographic (EEG) data analysis lack some of the important properties essential for quantitative assessment of the progress of the dysfunction of the human brain. EEG data are essentially nonlinear and this nonlinear time series has been identified as multi-fractal in nature. We need rigorous techniques for such analysis. In this article, we present the visibility graph as the latest, rigorous technique that can assess the degree of multifractality accurately and reliably. Moreover, it has also been found that this technique can give reliable results with test data of comparatively short length. In this work, the visibility graph algorithm has been used for mapping a time series-EEG signals-to a graph to study complexity and fractality of the time series through investigation of its complexity. The power of scale-freeness of visibility graph has been used as an effective method for measuring fractality in the EEG signal. The scale-freeness of the visibility graph has also been observed after averaging the statistically independent samples of the signal. Scale-freeness of the visibility graph has been calculated for 5 sets of EEG data patterns varying from normal eye closed to epileptic. The change in the values is analyzed further, and it has been observed that it reduces uniformly from normal eye closed to epileptic.},

abstract = {Objective To show that time-irreversible EEG signals recorded with intracranial electrodes during seizures can serve as markers of the epileptogenic zone. Methods We use the recently developed method of mapping time series into directed horizontal graphs (dHVG). Each node of the dHVG represents a time point in the original intracranial EEG (iEEG) signal. Statistically significant differences between the distributions of the nodes' number of input and output connections are used to detect time-irreversible iEEG signals. Results In 31 of 32 seizure recordings we found time-irreversible iEEG signals. The maximally time-irreversible signals always occurred during seizures, with highest probability in the middle of the first seizure half. These signals spanned a large range of frequencies and amplitudes but were all characterized by saw-tooth like shaped components. Brain regions removed from patients who became post-surgically seizure-free generated significantly larger time-irreversibilities than regions removed from patients who still had seizures after surgery. Conclusions Our results corroborate that ictal time-irreversible iEEG signals can indeed serve as markers of the epileptogenic zone and can be efficiently detected and quantified in a time-resolved manner by dHVG based methods. Significance Ictal time-irreversible EEG signals can help to improve pre-surgical evaluation in patients suffering from pharmaco-resistant epilepsies.},

Results: Our approach characterises the temporally varying phase difference of the hemispheric sunspot activity over the past 130 years, which is a major contribution to the north-south asymmetry. Coherent phase variables are found to exist for a frequency band with periodicities around the dominating 11-year cycle.

As an alternative to existing methods of time series analysis, in this paper we argue that the statistical proper- ties of recurrence networks – a recently developed approach – are promising candidates for characterising the system's nonlinear dynamics and quantifying structural changes in its reconstructed phase space as time evolves. In a first order approximation, the results of recurrence network analysis are invariant to changes in the age model and are not directly af- fected by non-equidistant sampling of the data. Specifically, we investigate the behaviour of recurrence network measures for both paradigmatic model systems with non-stationary pa- rameters and four marine records of long-term palaeoclimate variations. We show that the obtained results are qualita- tively robust under changes of the relevant parameters of our method, including detrending, size of the running window used for analysis, and embedding delay. We demonstrate that recurrence network analysis is able to detect relevant regime shifts in synthetic data as well as in problematic geoscien- tific time series.

The use of network representations in the characterization of time series complexity is a relatively new but quickly developing branch of time series analysis. In particular, beat-to-beat heart rate variability can be mapped out in a network of RR-increments, which is a directed and weighted graph with vertices representing RR-increments and the edges of which correspond to subsequent increments. We evaluate entropy measures selected from these network representations in records of healthy subjects and heart transplant patients, and provide an interpretation of the results.},

abstract = {Coherent or synchronous motion of oscillatory components is a feature of many geoscientific systems. In this work, we review and compare different possible approaches to detect and quantify the phase coherence between time series of oscillatory systems. In particular, methods originated in the theory of phase synchronisation phenomena and the concept of recurrence plots are considered. As a particular example, the sunspot activity on both solar hemispheres and the corresponding phenomenon of north-south asymmetry are studied. It is shown that this asymmetry can be understood in terms of a different "phase diffusion" of two coupled chaotic oscillators, which do however evolve coherently in time. The statistical reliability and implications of this result are discussed. Apart from the particular problem of sunspot activity, the methods described in this chapter may be used to study a variety of other phenomena in geoscientific systems, for example, the coherent motion of certain atmospheric oscillation patterns.},

abstract = {Potential paleoclimatic driving mechanisms acting on human evolution present an open problem of cross-disciplinary scientific interest. The analysis of paleoclimate archives encoding the environmental variability in East Africa during the past 5 Ma has triggered an ongoing debate about possible candidate processes and evolutionary mechanisms. In this work, we apply a nonlinear statistical technique, recurrence network analysis, to three distinct marine records of terrigenous dust flux. Our method enables us to identify three epochs with transitions between qualitatively different types of environmental variability in North and East Africa during the (i) Middle Pliocene (3.35-3.15 Ma B.P.), (ii) Early Pleistocene (2.25-1.6 Ma B.P.), and (iii) Middle Pleistocene (1.1-0.7 Ma B.P.). A deeper examination of these transition periods reveals potential climatic drivers, including (i) large-scale changes in ocean currents due to a spatial shift of the Indonesian throughflow in combination with an intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation, (ii) a global reorganization of the atmospheric Walker circulation induced in the tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean, and (iii) shifts in the dominating temporal variability pattern of glacial activity during the Middle Pleistocene, respectively. A reexamination of the available fossil record demonstrates statistically significant coincidences between the detected transition periods and major steps in hominin evolution. This result suggests that the observed shifts between more regular and more erratic environmental variability may have acted as a trigger for rapid change in the development of humankind in Africa.},

Then we convert these time series into networks using the horizontal visibility graph technique. Multifractal analysis of the resulting networks is performed using an algorithm proposed by us. The results from the multifractal analysis show that multifractality exists in both raw daily time series of X-ray brightness and their horizontal visibility graphs. It is also found that the empirical K(q) curves of raw time series can be fitted by the universal multifractal model. The numerical results on the raw data show that the Solar Cycle 23 is weaker than the Solar Cycle 22 in multifractality. The values of h(2) from multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis for these time series indicate that they are stationary and persistent, and the correlations in the time series of Solar Cycle 23 are stronger than those for Solar Cycle 22. Furthermore, the multifractal scaling for the networks of the time series can reflect some properties which cannot be picked up by using the same analysis on the original time series. This suggests a potentially useful method to explore geophysical data.},

Several methods have been proposed to this end, but most utilize too many features and produce unsuitable results. In the present, features are extracted based on the predicted secondary structures. At first, predicted secondary structure sequences are mapped into two time series by the chaos game representation. Then, a recurrence matrix is calculated from each of the time series. The recurrence matrix is identified with the adjacency matrix of a complex network and measures are applied for the characterization of complex networks to these recurrence matrixes. For a given protein sequence, a total of 24 characteristic features can be calculated and these are fed into Fisher's discriminated analysis algorithm for classification. To examine the proposed method, two widely used low similarity benchmark datasets design and test its performance. A comparison with the results of existing methods shows that the current study's approach provides a satisfactory performance for protein structural class prediction.},

abstract = {The family of visibility algorithms were recently introduced as mappings between time series and graphs. Here we extend this method to characterize spatially extended data structures by mapping scalar fields of arbitrary dimension into graphs. After introducing several possible extensions, we provide analytical results on some topological properties of these graphs associated to some types of real-valued matrices, which can be understood as the high and low disorder limits of real-valued scalar fields. In particular, we find a closed expression for the degree distribution of these graphs associated to uncorrelated random fields of generic dimension, extending a well known result in one-dimensional time series. As this result holds independently of the field's marginal distribution, we show that it directly yields a statistical randomness test, applicable in any dimension. We showcase its usefulness by discriminating spatial snapshots of two-dimensional white noise from snapshots of a two-dimensional lattice of diffusively coupled chaotic maps, a system that generates high dimensional spatio-temporal chaos. We finally discuss the range of potential applications of this combinatorial framework, which include image processing in engineering, the description of surface growth in material science, soft matter or medicine and the characterization of potential energy surfaces in chemistry, disordered systems and high energy physics. An illustration on the applicability of this method for the classification of the different stages involved in carcinogenesis is briefly discussed.},

The arriving probabilities of random walker in the network are utilized as the weights of the corresponding data. Compared with the classical OWA, the proposed OVGWA not only takes the information of orders but also the argument values themselves into consideration to determine the weights. An application of produced water management is used to illustrate the application of the proposed OVGWA aggregation operator. In addition, the aggregated results are compared with those obtained by maximal entropy method. The results show that the proposed method is effective. To study the impacts of the influencing factors, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out. It is utility to understand the role of different indicators on aggregated value.},

abstract = {Visibility graph (VG) and horizontal visibility graph (HVG) play a crucial role in modern complex network approaches to nonlinear time series analysis. However, depending on the underlying dynamic processes, it remains to characterize the exponents of presumably exponential degree distributions. It has been recently conjectured that there is a critical value of exponent $\lambda$c=ln3/2, which separates chaotic from correlated stochastic processes. Here, we systematically apply (H)VG analysis to time series from autoregressive (AR) models, which confirms the hypothesis that an increased correlation length results in larger values of $\lambda$ {\textgreater} $\lambda$c. On the other hand, we numerically find a regime of negatively correlated process increments where $\lambda$ {\textless} $\lambda$c, which is in contrast to this hypothesis. Furthermore, by constructing graphs based on re-sampled time series, we find that network measures show non-trivial dependencies on the autocorrelation functions of the processes. We propose to choose the decorrelation time as the maximal re-sampling delay for the algorithm. Our results are detailed for time series from AR(1) and AR(2) processes.},

abstract = {Exploiting the duality between time series and networks, directed horizontal visibility graphs (DHVGs) are used to perform an unprecedented analysis of the dynamics of stream flow fluctuations with focus on time irreversibility and long range dependence. The analysis relies on a large quality-controlled data set consisting of 699 daily time series recorded in the continental United States (CONUS) that are not affected by human activity and primarily reflects meteorological conditions. DHVGs allow a clear visualization and quantification of time irreversibility of flow dynamics, which can be interpreted as a signature of nonlinearity, and long range dependence resulting from the interaction of atmospheric, surface and underground processes acting at multiple spatio-temporal scales. Irreversibility is explored by mapping the time series into ingoing, outgoing, and undirected graphs and comparing the corresponding degree distributions. Using surrogate data preserving up to the second order linear temporal dependence properties of the observed series, DHVGs highlight the additional complexity introduced by nonlinearity into flow fluctuation dynamics. We show that the degree distributions do not decay exponentially as expected, but tend to follow a subexponential behavior, even though sampling uncertainty does not allow a clear distinction between apparent or true power law decay. These results confirm that the complexity of stream flow dynamics goes beyond a linear representation involving for instance the combination of linear processes with short and long range dependence, and requires modeling strategies accounting for temporal asymmetry and nonlinearity.},

In most of the cases simple measures based on the degree sequence (or functionals of these such as entropies over degree and joint degree distributions) appear to be highly informative features for automatic classification and provide nontrivial information on the associated dynam- ical process, working even better than more sophisticated topological metrics. It is thus an open question why these seemingly simple measures capture so much information. Here we prove that, under suitable conditions, there exist a bijection between the adjacency matrix of an HVG and its degree sequence, and we give an explicit construction of such bijection. As a consequence, under these conditions HVGs are unigraphs and the degree sequence fully encapsulates all the information of these graphs, thereby giving a plausible reason for its apparently unreasonable effectiveness.},

The measure is applied to compute the heterogeneity of synthetic (both random and scale free) and real world networks with its value normalized in the interval [0, 1]. To define the measure, we introduce a limiting network whose heterogeneity can be expressed analytically with the value tending to 1 as the size of the network N tends to infinity. We numerically study the variation of heterogeneity for random graphs (as a function of p and N) and for scale free networks with and N as variables. Finally, as a specific application, we show that the proposed measure can be used to compare the heterogeneity of recurrence networks constructed from the time series of several low dimensional chaotic attractors9thereby providing a single index to compare the structural complexity of chaotic attractors.},

abstract = {Nonlinear time series analysis aims at understanding the dynamics of stochastic or chaotic processes. In recent years, quite a few methods have been proposed to transform a single time series to a complex network so that the dynamics of the process can be understood by investigating the topological properties of the network. We study the topological properties of horizontal visibility graphs constructed from fractional Brownian motions with different Hurst indexes H ∈ (0,1). Special attention has been paid to the impact of the Hurst index on topological properties. It is found that the clustering coefficient C decreases when H increases. We also found that the mean length L of the shortest paths increases exponentially with H for fixed length N of the original time series. In addition, L increases linearly with respect to N when H is close to 1 and in a logarithmic form when H is close to 0. Although the occurrence of different motifs changes with H, the motif rank pattern remains unchanged for different H. Adopting the node-covering box-counting method, the horizontal visibility graphs are found to be fractals and the fractal dimension dBdecreases with H. Furthermore, the Pearson coefficients of the networks are positive and the degree-degree correlations increase with degree, which indicate that the horizontal visibility graphs are assortative. With the increase of H, the Pearson coefficient decreases first and then increases, in which the turning point is around H = 0.6. The presence of both fractality and assortativity in the horizontal visibility graphs converted from fractional Brownian motions is different from many cases where fractal networks are usually disassortative. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this article, we propose a novel method for transforming a time series into a complex network graph. The proposed algorithm is based on the spatial distribution of a time series. The characteristics of geometric pa- rameters of a network represent the dynamic characteristics of a time series. Our algorithm transforms, respectively, a constant series into a fully connected graph, periodic time series into a regular graph, linear di- vergent time series into a tree, and chaotic time series into an approximately power law distribution network graph. We find that when the dimension of reconstructed phase space increases, the corresponding graph for a random time series quickly turns into a completely unconnected graph, while that for a chaotic time series maintains a certain level of connectivity. The characteristics of the generated network, including the total edges, the degree distribution, and the clustering coefficient, reflect the characteristics of the time series, including diverging speed, level of certainty, and level of randomness. This observation allows a chaotic time series to be easily identified from a random time series. The method may be useful for analysis of complex nonlinear systems such as chaos and random systems, by perceiving the differences in the outcomes of the sys- tems—the time series—in the identification of the systemic levels of certainty or randomness.},

By using the Lorenz system and real data, we demonstrate that the global clustering coefficient is robust to the embedding parameters.

The results showed that global clustering coefficients of BFO significantly decreased in response to loading ( {\&}{\#}60;0.05).

For that, we use a novel approach, namely the $\epsilon$- recurrence networks applied to a phase space constructed by means of the time series of the variabilities of the heart rate, and the blood pressure (systolic and diastolic). Four networkmeasures are considered as parameters for our analysis: average path length, mean coreness, global clustering coefficient, and scale- local transitivity dimension. With these quantities, we perform a quadratic discriminant analysis. This allows us to classify healthy and preeclamptic patients with a sensitivity of 91.7{\%} and a specificity of 68.1{\%}, thus validating the use of this method.},

abstract = {The East Asian–Indonesian–Australian summer monsoon (EAIASM) links the Earth's hemispheres and provides a heat source that drives global circulation. At seasonal and inter-seasonal timescales, the summer monsoon of one hemisphere is linked via outflows from the winter monsoon of the opposing hemisphere. Long-term phase relationships between the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and the Indonesian–Australian summer monsoon (IASM) are poorly understood, raising questions of long-term adjustments to future greenhouse-triggered climate change and whether these changes could 'lock in' possible IASM and EASM phase relationships in a region dependent on monsoonal rainfall. Here we show that a newly developed nonlinear time series analysis technique allows confident identification of strong versus weak monsoon phases at millennial to sub-centennial timescales. We find a see–saw relationship over the last 9,000 years—with strong and weak monsoons opposingly phased and triggered by solar variations. Our results provide insights into centennial-to millennial-scale relationships within the wider EAIASM regime.},

@article{Ahmadlou2012,
abstract = {Recently, the visibility graph (VG) algorithm was proposed for mapping a time series to a graph to study complexity and fractality of the time series through investigation of the complexity of its graph. The visibility graph algorithm converts a fractal time series to a scale-free graph. VG has been used for the investigation of fractality in the dynamic behavior of both artificial and natural complex systems. However, robustness and performance of the power of scale-freeness of VG (PSVG) as an effective method for measuring fractality has not been investigated. Since noise is unavoidable in real life time series, the robustness of a fractality measure is of paramount importance. To improve the accuracy and robustness of PSVG to noise for measurement of fractality of time series in biological time-series, an improved PSVG is presented in this paper. The proposed method is evaluated using two examples: a synthetic benchmark time series and a complicated real life Electroencephalograms (EEG)-based diagnostic problem, that is distinguishing autistic children from non-autistic children. It is shown that the proposed improved PSVG is less sensitive to noise and therefore more robust compared with PSVG. Further, it is shown that using improved PSVG in the wavelet-chaos neural network model of Adeli and c-workers in place of the Katz fractality dimension results in a more accurate diagnosis of autism, a complicated neurological and psychiatric disorder. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Recently, the construction of networks from time series data has gained widespread interest. In this paper, we develop this area further by introducing a network construction procedure for pseudoperiodic time series. We call such networks episode networks, in which an episode corresponds to a temporal interval of a time series, and which defines a node in the network. Our model includes a number of features which distinguish it from current methods. First, the proposed construction procedure is a parametric model which allows it to adapt to the characteristics of the data; the length of an episode being the parameter. As a direct consequence, networks of minimal size containing the maximal information about the time series can be obtained. In this paper, we provide an algorithm to determine the optimal value of this parameter. Second, we employ estimates of mutual information values to define the connectivity structure among the nodes in the network to exploit efficiently the nonlinearities in the time series. Finally, we apply our method to data from electroencephalogram (EEG) experiments and demonstrate that the constructed episode networks capture discriminative information from the underlying time series that may be useful for diagnostic purposes.},

abstract = {Characterizing the mechanism of drop formation at the interface of horizontal oil-water stratified flows is a fundamental problem eliciting a great deal of attention from different disciplines. We experimentally and theoretically investigate the formation and transition of horizontal oil-water stratified flows. We design a new multi-sector conductance sensor and measure multivariate signals from two different stratified flow patterns. Using the Adaptive Optimal Kernel Time-Frequency Representation (AOK TFR) we first characterize the flow behavior from an energy and frequency point of view. Then, we infer multivariate recurrence networks from the experimental data and investigate the cross-transitivity for each constructed network. We find that the cross-transitivity allows quantitatively uncovering the flow behavior when the stratified flow evolves from a stable state to an unstable one and recovers deeper insights into the mechanism governing the formation of droplets at the interface of stratified flows, a task that existing methods based on AOK TFR fail to work. These findings present a first step towards an improved understanding of the dynamic mechanism leading to the transition of horizontal oil-water stratified flows from a complex-network perspective.},

Recent works show that the degree distribution of these graphs encapsulates much information on the signals variability, and therefore constitutes a fundamental feature for statistical learning purposes. However, exact solutions for the degree distributions are only known in a few cases, such as for uncorrelated random processes. Here we analytically explore these distributions in a list of situations. We present a diagrammatic formalism which computes for all degrees their corresponding probability as a series expansion in a coupling constant which is the number of hidden variables. We offer a constructive solution for general Markovian stochastic processes and deterministic maps. As case tests we focus on Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, fully chaotic and quasiperiodic maps. Whereas only for certain degree probabilities can all diagrams be summed exactly, in the general case we show that the perturbation theory converges. In a second part, we make use of a variational technique to predict the complete degree distribution for special classes of Markovian dynamics with fast-decaying correlations. In every case we compare the theory with numerical experiments.},

The traffic dynamics can then be studied by investigating the statistical properties of those networks. According to Kerner's three-phase theory, there are two different phases in congested traffic, synchronized flow and wide moving jam. In the framework of this theory, we study different properties of synchronized flow and moving jam in relation to complex network. Scale-free network is constructed in stop-and-go traffic, i.e., a sequence of moving jams [Chin. Phys. Lett. 10, 2711 (2005)]. In this work, the networks generated in synchronized flow are investigated in detail. Simulation results show that the degree distribution of the networks constructed in synchronized flow has two power law regions, so the distinction in topological structure can really reflect the different dynamics in traffic flow. Furthermore, the real traffic data are investigated by this method, and the results are consistent with the simulations.},

abstract = {Network theory provides various tools for investigating the structural or functional topology of many complex systems found in nature, technology and society. Nevertheless, it has recently been realised that a considerable number of systems of interest should be treated, more appropriately, as interacting networks or networks of networks. Here we introduce a novel graph-theoretical framework for studying the interaction structure between subnetworks embedded within a complex network of networks. This framework allows us to quantify the structural role of single vertices or whole subnetworks with respect to the interaction of a pair of subnetworks on local, mesoscopic and global topological scales. Climate networks have recently been shown to be a powerful tool for the analysis of climatological data. Applying the general framework for studying interacting networks, we introduce coupled climate subnetworks to represent and investigate the topology of statistical relationships between the fields of distinct climatological variables. Using coupled climate subnetworks to investigate the terrestrial atmosphere's three-dimensional geopotential height field uncovers known as well as interesting novel features of the atmosphere's vertical stratification and general circulation. Specifically, the new measure "cross-betweenness" identifies regions which are particularly important for mediating vertical wind field interactions.

abstract = {In this work, we propose a novel method to transform a time series into a weighted and directed network. For a given time series, we first generate a set of segments via a sliding window, and then use a doubly symbolic scheme to characterize every windowed segment by combining absolute amplitude information with an ordinal pattern characterization. Based on this construction, a network can be directly constructed from the given time series: segments corresponding to different symbol-pairs are mapped to network nodes and the temporal succession between nodes is represented by directed links. With this conversion, dynamics underlying the time series has been encoded into the network structure. We illustrate the potential of our networks with a well-studied dynamical model as a benchmark example. Results show that network measures for characterizing global properties can detect the dynamical transitions in the underlying system. Moreover, we employ a random walk algorithm to sample loops in our networks, and find that time series with different dynamics exhibits distinct cycle structure. That is, the relative prevalence of loops with different lengths can be used to identify the underlying dynamics.},

abstract = {The visibility graph approach and complex network theory provide a new insight into time series analysis. The inheritance of the visibility graph from the original time series was further explored in the paper. We found that degree distributions of visibility graphs extracted from Pseudo Brownian Motion series obtained by the Frequency Domain algorithm exhibit exponential behaviors, in which the exponential exponent is a binomial function of the Hurst index inherited in the time series. Our simulations presented that the quantitative relations between the Hurst indexes and the exponents of degree distribution function are different for different series and the visibility graph inherits some important features of the original time series. Further, we convert some quarterly macroeconomic series including the growth rates of value-added of three industry series and the growth rates of Gross Domestic Product series of China to graphs by the visibility algorithm and explore the topological properties of graphs associated from the four macroeconomic series, namely, the degree distribution and correlations, the clustering coefficient, the average path length, and community structure. Based on complex network analysis we find degree distributions of associated networks from the growth rates of value-added of three industry series are almost exponential and the degree distributions of associated networks from the growth rates of GDP series are scale free. We also discussed the assortativity and disassortativity of the four associated networks as they are related to the evolutionary process of the original macroeconomic series. All the constructed networks have "small-world" features. The community structures of associated networks suggest dynamic changes of the original macroeconomic series. We also detected the relationship among government policy changes, community structures of associated networks and macroeconomic dynamics. We find great influences of government policies in China on the changes of dynamics of GDP and the three industries adjustment. The work in our paper provides a new way to understand the dynamics of economic development. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to predict atrial fibrillation (AF) from epicardial signals by investigating the recurrence property of atrial activity dynamic system before AF. A novel scheme is proposed to predict AF by using multi-threshold spectra of the recurrence complex network. Firstly, epicardial signals are transformed into the recurrence complex network to quantify structural properties of the recurrence in the phase space. Spectral parameters with multi-threshold are used to characterize the global structure of the network. Then the feature sequential forward searching algorithm and mutual information based Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy criterion are used to find the optimal feature set. Finally, a support vector machine is used to predict the occurrence of AF. This method is assessed on the pre-AF epicardial signals of canine which includes the normal group A (no further AF will happen), the mild group B (the following AF time is less than 180 s) and the severe group C (the following AF time is more than 180 s). 25 optimal features are selected out of 180 features from each sample. With these features, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy are 99.40{\%}, 99.70{\%} and 99.60{\%}, respectively, which are the best among the recurrence based methods. The results suggest that the proposed method can predict AF accurately and thus can be prospectively used in the postoperative evaluation. {\textcopyright} 2012 IPEM.},

abstract = {This study introduces an approach to study the multiscale transmission characteristics of the correlation modes between bivariate time series. The correlation between the bivariate time series fluctuates over time. The transmission among the correlation modes exhibits a multiscale phenomenon, which provides richer information. To investigate the multiscale transmission of the correlation modes, this paper describes a hybrid model integrating wavelet analysis and complex network theory to decompose and reconstruct the original bivariate time series into sequences in a joint time-frequency domain and defined the correlation modes at each time-frequency domain. We chose the crude oil spot and futures prices as the sample data. The empirical results indicate that the main duration of volatility (32-64 days) for the strongly positive correlation between the crude oil spot price and the futures price provides more useful information for investors. Moreover, the weighted degree, weighted indegree and weighted outdegree of the correlation modes follow power-law distributions. The correlation fluctuation strengthens the extent of persistence over the long term, whereas persistence weakens over the short and medium term. The primary correlation modes dominating the transmission process and the major intermediary modes in the transmission process are clustered both in the short and long term.},

abstract = {Solar activity is characterized by complex dynamics superimposed onto an almost periodic, approximately 11-year cycle. One of its main features is the presence of a marked, time-varying hemispheric asymmetry, the deeper reasons for which have not yet been completely uncovered. Traditionally, this asymmetry has been studied by considering amplitude and phase differences. Here, we use visibility graphs, a novel tool of nonlinear time series analysis, to obtain complementary information on hemispheric asymmetries in dynamical properties. Our analysis provides deep insights into the potential and limitations of this method, revealing a complex interplay between factors relating to statistical and dynamical properties, i.e., effects due to the probability distribution and the regularity of observed fluctuations. We demonstrate that temporal changes in the hemispheric predominance of the graph properties lag those directly associated with the total hemispheric sunspot areas. Our findings open a new dynamical perspective on studying the north–south sunspot asymmetry, which is to be further explored in future work.},

We show that this distinction in topological structure results from the hierarchy of unstable periodic orbits embedded in the chaotic attractor. Standard measures of structure in complex networks can therefore be applied to distinguish different dynamic regimes in time series.

Recently, several maps from a time series to a network have been proposed with the intent of using network metrics to characterize time series. Although these maps demonstrate that different time series result in networks with distinct topological properties, it remains unclear how these topological properties relate to the original time series. Here, we propose a map from a time series to a network with an approximate inverse operation, making it possible to use network statistics to characterize time series and time series statistics to characterize networks. As a proof of concept, we generate an ensemble of time series ranging from periodic to random and confirm that application of the proposed map retains much of the information encoded in the original time series (or networks) after application of the map (or its inverse). Our results suggest that network analysis can be used to distinguish different dynamic regimes in time series and, perhaps more importantly, time series analysis can provide a powerful set of tools that augment the traditional network analysis toolkit to quantify networks in new and useful ways.},

The application of the most effective algorithm to the typical chaotic Lorenz system verifies the correctness of such an effective algorithm. It is verified that, based on the unthresholded RPs, one can reconstruct the original attractor by choosing different RP thresholds based on the Hirata algorithm. It is shown that, in real applications, it is possible to reconstruct the underlying dynamics by using quite little information from observations of real dynamical systems.

abstract = {Although the existence of a north-south asymmetry in solar activity is generally accepted, a detailed study of its significance and behaviour is still missing. In this paper, we present a thorough study of the north-south asymmetry of solar activity made with the daily sunspot areas, since they are a good indicator of magnetic activity. To perform the study, we have constructed an asymmetry time series and analysed it by different methods. First of all, its significance and statistical behaviour has been studied. Secondly, using a Montecarlo simulation we have generated synthetic asymmetries and compared them to the real one by means of an $\chi$2-test of goodness of fit, and thirdly, we have used modern techniques, developed to study the chaotic behaviour of time series, to search for low-dimensional deterministic chaos in the asymmetry time series. Our results show that in most cases the north-south asymmetry is statistically highly significant, i.e. it is a real feature of sunspot areas distribution, and that it cannot be obtained from a distribution of sunspot areas generated, in a random way, from a binomial or uniform distribution of probability between hemispheres; moreover, synthetic asymmetries obtained from the Morfill et al. (1991) model, which seems to reproduce realistically the sunspot cycle, do not agree with the real one and the real asymmetry time series can be represented by means of a multicomponent model made up of a long-term trend, a sinusoidal component with a period of 12.1 yr and a dominant purely random component. Also, the chaotic analysis does not reveal the existence of a strange attractor in the time series and its multifractal properties indicate that intermittency or bursts of activity are present in it.},

The exercise heart rate dynamics were suggestive of only mild, if any parasympathetic reinnervation of the graft with persisting sympathetic activation. On the other hand, traditional heart rate variability (HRV) indices were inadequately high, due to erratic rhythm resulting from interference of the persisting recipient sinus node or non-conducted atrial parasystole.

abstract = {The dynamics of a complex system is usually recorded in the form of time series, which can be studied through its visibility graph from a complex network perspective. We investigate the visibility graphs extracted from fractional Brownian motions and multifractal random walks, and find that the degree distributions exhibit power-law behaviors, in which the power-law exponent $\alpha$ is a linear function of the Hurst index H of the time series. We also find that the degree distribution of the visibility graph is mainly determined by the temporal correlation of the original time series with minor influence from the possible multifractal nature. As an example, we study the visibility graphs constructed from three Chinese stock market indexes and unveil that the degree distributions have power-law tails, where the tail exponents of the visibility graphs and the Hurst indexes of the indexes are close to the $\alpha$ ∼ H linear relationship. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Chaotic attractors are known to often exhibit not only complex dynamics but also a complex geometry in phase space. In this work, we provide a detailed characterization of chaotic electrochemical oscillations obtained experimentally as well as numerically from a corresponding mathematical model. Power spectral density and recurrence time distributions reveal a considerable increase of dynamic complexity with increasing temperature of the system, resulting in a larger relative spread of the attractor in phase space. By allowing for feasible coordinate transformations, we demonstrate that the system, however, remains phase-coherent over the whole considered parameter range. This finding motivates a critical review of existing definitions of phase coherence that are exclusively based on dynamical characteristics and are thus potentially sensitive to projection effects in phase space. In contrast, referring to the attractor geometry, the gradual changes in some fundamental properties of the system commonly related to its phase coherence can be alternatively studied from a purely structural point of view. As a prospective example for a corresponding framework, recurrence network analysis widely avoids undesired projection effects that otherwise can lead to ambiguous results of some existing approaches to studying phase coherence. Our corresponding results demonstrate that since temperature increase induces more complex chaotic chemical reactions, the recurrence network properties describing attractor geometry also change gradually: the bimodality of the distribution of local clustering coefficients due to the attractor's band structure disappears, and the corresponding asymmetry of the distribution as well as the average path length increase.},

We use the methods and measures of recurrence plot and recurrence network generated from the time series for this analysis. We explicitly show that the addition of noise obscures the property of recurrence of trajectory points in the phase space which is the hallmark of every dynamical system. However, the structure of the attractor is found to be robust even upto high noise levels of 50{\%}. An advantage of recurrence network measures over the conventional nonlinear measures is that they can be applied on short and non stationary time series data. By using the results obtained from the above analysis, we go on to analyse the light curves from a dominant black hole system and show that the recurrence network measures are capable of identifying the nature of noise contamination in a time series.},

Although some dynamical behaviors can be effectively captured by existing approaches, the preservation and tracking of the temporal behaviors of a chaotic system remains an open problem. In this work, we extended the visibility graphlet approach to investigate both discrete and continuous chaotic time series. We applied visibility graphlets to capture the reconstructed local states, so that each is treated as a node and tracked downstream to create a temporal chain link. Our empirical findings show that the approach accurately captures the dynamical properties of chaotic systems. Networks constructed from periodic dynamic phases all converge to regular networks and to unique network structures for each model in the chaotic zones. Furthermore, our results show that the characterization of chaotic and non-chaotic zones in the Lorenz system corresponds to the maximal Lyapunov exponent, thus providing a simple and straightforward way to analyze chaotic systems.},

Both the cross-wavelet transform (XWT) and wavelet coherence (WTC) indicate the prominent period with 95{\%} confidence level, namely the Schwabe cycle of about 11 years. The Schwabe cycle is in phase in the two hemispheres. Within the 11-year frequency band, there is a small phase difference during the period of 1966 - 1975 when the activity of polar faculae in the northern hemisphere slightly leads the one in the southern hemisphere. A cross-recurrence plot analysis and the line of synchronization (LOS) extracted from the cross-recurrence plot show further the phase difference between the two hemispheres. The LOS deviates significantly from the main diagonal during the period of 1965 - 1970 and LOS {\textgreater} 0, showing that the activity of polar faculae in the northern hemisphere leads in phase, which is in accordance with XWT and WTC analyses.

abstract = {This paper presents a new approach for analysing the structural properties of time series from complex systems. Starting from the concept of recurrences in phase space, the recurrence matrix of a time series is interpreted as the adjacency matrix of an associated complex network, which links different points in time if the considered states are closely neighboured in phase space. In comparison with similar network-based techniques the new approach has important conceptual advantages, and can be considered as a unifying framework for transforming time series into complex networks that also includes other existing methods as special cases. It has been demonstrated here that there are fundamental relationships between many topological properties of recurrence networks and different nontrivial statistical properties of the phase space density of the underlying dynamical system. Hence, this novel interpretation of the recurrence matrix yields new quantitative characteristics (such as average path length, clustering coefficient, or centrality measures of the recurrence network) related to the dynamical complexity of a time series, most of which are not yet provided by other existing methods of nonlinear time series analysis. 6},

Counting forbidden patterns has been shown to be a powerful tool towards the detection of determinism in noisy time series. They constitute a set of ordinal symbolic patterns that cannot be realised in time series generated by deterministic systems. The reliability of the estimator of the relative count of forbidden patterns from irregularly sampled data has been explored in two recent studies. In this paper, we explore highly irregular sampling frequency schemes. Using numerically generated data, we examine the reliability of the estimator when the sampling period has been drawn from exponential, Pareto and Gamma distributions of varying skewness. Our investigations demonstrate that some statistical properties of the sampling distribution are useful heuristics for assessing the estimator's reliability. We find that sampling in the presence of large chronological gaps can still yield relatively accurate estimates as long as the time series contains sufficiently many densely sampled areas. Furthermore, we show that the reliability of the estimator of forbidden patterns is poor when there is a high number of sampling intervals, which are larger than a typical correlation time of the underlying system.},

Further, we take into account other topological properties such as maximum eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix and the degree assortativity, and show that such topological quantities can also be used to predict the Hurst exponent, with an exception for anti-persistent fractional Gaussian noises. To solve this problem, we take into account the Spearman correlation coefficient between nodes' degrees and their corresponding data values in the original time series.},

We set them as the ones giving the maximum Shannon entropy of the diagonal line length distribution for the first simultaneous minima of recurrence rate and Shannon entropy. To identify metastable states, as well as the transitions between them, we use a soft partitioning algorithm for module finding which is specifically developed for the case in which a system shows metastability.

A recently developed algorithm in graph theory, visibility graph (VG), is applied in this research. The approach is based on the key discovery that high-frequency oscillation takes place during epileptic seizure, making it a marker of epilepsy. Therefore, the nonlinear property of the high-frequency signal may be more noticeable. Hence, a complexity measure, called graph index complexity (GIC), is computed using the VG of the patients' high-frequency ECoG subband. After comparison and statistical analysis, the nonlinear feature is proved to be effective in detection and location of the epilepsy. Two different traditional complexities, sample entropy and Lempel-Ziv, were also calculated to make a comparison and prove that GIC provides better identification.},

By mapping mono/multivariate time series into networks, one can investigate both it's microscopic and macroscopic behaviors. However, most proposed approaches lead to the construction of static networks consequently providing limited information on evolutionary behaviors. In the present paper we propose a method called visibility graph based time series analysis, in which series segments are mapped to visibility graphs as being descriptions of the corresponding states and the successively occurring states are linked. This procedure converts a time series to a temporal network and at the same time a network of networks. Findings from empirical records for stock markets in USA (S{\&}P500 and Nasdaq) and artificial series generated by means of fractional Gaussian motions show that the method can provide us rich information benefiting short-term and long-term predictions. Theoretically, we propose a method to investigate time series from the viewpoint of network of networks.},

Hence, complexity of EEGs is computed using the VGs of EEGs and EEG sub-bands produced by wavelet decomposition. Two methods are employed for computation of complexity of the VGs: one based on the power of scale-freeness of a graph structure and the other based on the maximum eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a graph. Analysis of variation is used for feature selection. Two classifiers are applied to the selected features to distinguish AD and control EEGs: a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) and a two-stage classifier consisting of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the RBFNN. After comprehensive statistical studies, effective classification features and mathematical markers were discovered. Finally, using the discovered features and a two-stage classifier (PCA-RBFNN), a high diagnostic accuracy of 97.7{\%} was obtained.},

abstract = {Recently, a framework for analyzing time series by constructing an associated complex network has attracted significant research interest. One of the advantages of the complex network method for studying time series is that complex network theory provides a tool to describe either important nodes, or structures that exist in the networks, at different topological scale. This can then provide distinct information for time series of different dynamical systems. In this paper, we systematically investigate the recurrence-based phase space network of order k that has previously been used to specify different types of dynamics in terms of the motif ranking from a different perspective. Globally, we find that the network size scales with different scale exponents and the degree distribution follows a quasi-symmetric bell shape around the value of 2k with different values of degree variance from periodic to chaotic R?ssler systems. Local network properties such as the vertex degree, the clustering coefficients and betweenness centrality are found to be sensitive to the local stability of the orbits and hence contain complementary information.},

Specifically, we focus on the case of k-nearest neighbour networks, which have already been shown to contain meaningful (and more importantly, easily accessible) information about dynamics. Superfamily phenomena have previously been identified, although a complete explanation for its appearance was not provided. Local dimension of the attractor is presented as one possible determinant, discussing the ability of specific motifs to be embedded in various dimensions. In turn, the Lyapunov spectrum provides the link between attractor dimension and dynamics required. We also prove invertibility of k-nearest neighbour networks. A new metric is provided, under which the k-nearest neighbour and $\epsilon$-recurrence construction methods produce identical networks. Hence, the already established $\epsilon$-recurrence inversion algorithm applies equally to the k-nearest neighbour case, and inversion is proved. The change in metric necessarily distorts the shape of the reconstructed attractor, although topology is conserved.},

abstract = {Network theory provides a rich toolbox consisting of methods, measures, and models for studying the structure and dynamics of complex systems found in nature, society, or technology. Recently, it has been pointed out that many real-world complex systems are more adequately mapped by networks of interacting or interdependent networks, e.g., a power grid showing interdependency with a communication network. Additionally, in many real-world situations it is reasonable to include node weights into complex network statistics to reflect the varying size or importance of subsystems that are represented by nodes in the network of interest. E.g., nodes can represent vastly different surface area in climate networks, volume in brain networks or economic capacity in trade networks. In this letter, combining both ideas, we derive a novel class of statistical measures for analysing the structure of networks of interacting networks with heterogeneous node weights. Using a prototypical spatial network model, we show that the newly introduced node-weighted interacting network measures indeed provide an improved representation of the underlying system's properties as compared to their unweighted analogues. We apply our method to study the complex network structure of cross-boundary trade between European Union (EU) and non-EU countries finding that it provides important information on trade balance and economic robustness.},

We have studied the behavior of the relative number of clusters in dynamic visibility graphs near the critical value of the angle of view. Time series of different nature both artificial and experimental were numerically investigated. In all cases, the dependence of the relative number of clusters on the proximity to the critical angle of view had a power law behavior. Thus, it was shown that there is a similarity between the behavior of the relative number of clusters and the order parameter in the second-order phase transition theory and percolation theory. Each time series is characterized by its own value of the critical index - an analog of the critical index in second-order phase transition theory.},

abstract = {Synchronisation between coupled oscillatory systems is a common phenomenon in many natural as well as technical systems. Varying the strength of coupling often leads to qualitative changes in the complex dynamics of the mutually coupled systems including different types of synchronisation such as phase, lag, generalised, or even complete synchronisation. Here, we study the geometric signatures of coupling along with the onset of generalised synchronisation between two coupled chaotic oscillators by mapping the systems' individual as well as joint recurrences in phase space to a complex network. For a paradigmatic continuous-time model system, the transitivity properties of the resulting joint recurrence networks display distinct variations associated with changes in the structural similarity between different parts of the considered trajectories. They therefore provide a useful indicator for the emergence of generalised synchronisation. This paper is dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the introduction of recurrence plots by Eckmann et al. (Europhys. Lett. 4 (1987), 973).},

One key problem in applying RPs and RQA is the selection of suitable parameters for the data under investigation. Whereas various well-established methods for the selection of embedding parameters exists, the question of choosing an appropriate threshold has not yet been answered satisfactorily. The recommendations found in the literature are rather rules of thumb than actual guidelines. In this paper we address the issue of threshold selection in RP/RQA. The core criterion for choosing a threshold is the power in signal detection that threshold yields. We will validate our approach by applying it to model as well as real-life data.},

It requires considerations of not only the extraction of important words or phrases from a text, but also the generation of abstractive ones that do not appear in the text. In this paper, we propose an approach that uses word embedding vectors as an external knowledge base for both keyword extraction and generation. Our evaluation shows that our app-roach outperforms many baseline algorithms, and is comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithm on our chosen dataset. In addition, we also introduce a new approach for evaluating the task of keyword extraction, that overcomes a common problem of overly strict matching criteria. We show that using word embedding vectors is a simpler, yet effective, method for both keyword extraction and generation.},

abstract = {The dynamical systems found in Nature are rarely isolated. Instead they interact and influence each other. The coupling functions that connect them contain detailed information about the functional mechanisms underlying the interactions and prescribe the physical rule specifying how an interaction occurs. Here, we aim to present a coherent and comprehensive review encompassing the rapid progress made recently in the analysis, understanding and applications of coupling functions. The basic concepts and characteristics of coupling functions are presented through demonstrative examples of different domains, revealing the mechanisms and emphasizing their multivariate nature. The theory of coupling functions is discussed through gradually increasing complexity from strong and weak interactions to globally-coupled systems and networks. A variety of methods that have been developed for the detection and reconstruction of coupling functions from measured data is described. These methods are based on different statistical techniques for dynamical inference. Stemming from physics, such methods are being applied in diverse areas of science and technology, including chemistry, biology, physiology, neuroscience, social sciences, mechanics and secure communications. This breadth of application illustrates the universality of coupling functions for studying the interaction mechanisms of coupled dynamical systems.},

abstract = {Understanding the nonlinear and complex dynamics underlying the gasliquid slug flow is a significant but challenging problem. We systematically carried out gasliquid two-phase flow experiments for measuring the time series of flow signals, which is studied in terms of the mapping from time series to complex networks. In particular, we construct directed weighted complex networks (DWCN) from time series and then associate different aspects of chaotic dynamics with the topological indices of the DWCN and further demonstrate that the DWCN can be exploited to detect unstable periodic orbits of low periods. Examples using time series from classical chaotic systems are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We construct and analyze numbers of DWCNs for different gasliquid flow patterns and find that our approach can quantitatively distinguish different experimental gasliquid flow patterns. Furthermore, the DWCN analysis indicates that slug flow shows obvious chaotic behavior and its unstable periodic orbits reflect the intermittent quasi-periodic oscillation behavior between liquid slug and large gas slug. These interesting and significant findings suggest that the directed weighted complex network can potentially be a powerful tool for uncovering the underlying dynamics leading to the formation of the gasliquid slug flow. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Long-range correlated processes are ubiquitous, ranging from climate variables to financial time series. One paradigmatic example for such processes is fractional Brownian motion (fBm). In this work, we highlight the potentials and conceptual as well as practical limitations when applying the recently proposed recurrence network (RN) approach to fBm and related stochastic processes. In particular, we demonstrate that the results of a previous application of RN analysis to fBm [Liu et al. Phys. Rev. E 89, 032814 (2014), 10.1103/PhysRevE.89.032814] are mainly due to an inappropriate treatment disregarding the intrinsic nonstationarity of such processes. Complementarily, we analyze some RN properties of the closely related stationary fractional Gaussian noise (fGn) processes and find that the resulting network properties are well-defined and behave as one would expect from basic conceptual considerations. Our results demonstrate that RN analysis can indeed provide meaningful results for stationary stochastic processes, given a proper selection of its intrinsic methodological parameters, whereas it is prone to fail to uniquely retrieve RN properties for nonstationary stochastic processes like fBm.},
