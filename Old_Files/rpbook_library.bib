	Abstract = {Analysis of the 140-year historical record suggests that the inverse relationship between the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian summer monsoon (weak monsoon arising from warm ENSO event) has broken down in recent decades. Two possible reasons emerge from the analyses. A southeastward shift in the Walker circulation anomalies associated with ENSO events may lead to a reduced subsidence over the Indian region, thus favoring normal monsoon conditions. Additionally, increased surface temperatures over Eurasia in winter and spring, which are a part of the midlatitude continental warming trend, may favor the enhanced land-ocean thermal gradient conducive to a strong monsoon. These observations raise the possibility that the Eurasian warming in recent decades helps to sustain the monsoon rainfall at a normal level despite strong ENSO events.},

	Abstract = {Summer monsoons (South Asian monsoon, South China Sea monsoon and Subtropical monsoon) are prominent features of summertime climate over southern China. Different monsoons carry different inflow moisture into China and control the temporal and spatial distributions of precipitation. Analyses of meteorological data, particularly wind, temperature and pressure anomalies are traditional methods of characterizing moisture sources and transport patterns. Here, we try to utilize the evidence from stable isotopes signatures to trace summer monsoons over southern China. Based on seven CHNIP (Chinese Network of Isotopes in Precipitation) observatory stations located in southern China, monthly composite precipitation samples have been collected and analyzed for the composition of $\delta$ 18 O during July, 2005. The results indicated that the spatial distributions of $\delta$ 18 O in precipitation could properly portray the moisture sources together with their transport pathways. Moreover, the amount effect, altitude effect, temperature effect and the correlation between $\delta$ 18 O vs. relative humidity were discussed.},

	Abstract = {Geoscientific measurements often provide time series with irregular time sampling, requiring either data reconstruction (interpolation) or sophisticated methods to handle irregular sampling. We compare the linear interpolation technique and different approaches for analyzing the correlation functions and persistence of irregularly sampled time series, as Lomb-Scargle Fourier transformation and kernel-based methods. In a thorough benchmark test we investigate the performance of these techniques.<br><br>All methods have comparable root mean square errors (RMSEs) for low skewness of the inter-observation time distribution. For high skewness, very irregular data, interpolation bias and RMSE increase strongly. We find a 40\% lower RMSE for the lag-1 autocorrelation function (ACF) for the Gaussian kernel method vs. the linear interpolation scheme, in the analysis of highly irregular time series. For the cross correlation function (CCF) the RMSE is then lower by 60\%. The application of the Lomb-Scargle technique gave results comparable to the kernel methods for the univariate, but poorer results in the bivariate case. Especially the high-frequency components of the signal, where classical methods show a strong bias in ACF and CCF magnitude, are preserved when using the kernel methods.<br><br>We illustrate the performances of interpolation vs. Gaussian kernel method by applying both to paleo-data from four locations, reflecting late Holocene Asian monsoon variability as derived from speleothem delta(18)O measurements. Cross correlation results are similar for both methods, which we attribute to the long time scales of the common variability. The persistence time (memory) is strongly overestimated when using the standard, interpolation-based, approach. Hence, the Gaussian kernel is a reliable and more robust estimator with significant advantages compared to other techniques and suitable for large scale application to paleo-data. },

The summer monsoon correlates with solar variability, Northern Hemisphere and Chinese temperature, Alpine glacial retreat, and Chinese cultural changes. It was generally strong during Europe's Medieval Warm Period and weak during Europe's Little Ice Age, as well as during the final decades of the Tang, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties, all times that were characterized by popular unrest. It was strong during the first several decades of the Northern Song Dynasty, a period of increased rice cultivation and dramatic population increase. The sign of the correlation between the AM and temperature switches around 1960, suggesting that anthropogenic forcing superseded natural forcing as the major driver of AM changes in the late 20th century.},

We critically evaluate potential policy-relevant tipping elements in the climate system under anthropogenic forcing, drawing on the pertinent literature and a recent international workshop to compile a short list, and we assess where their tipping points lie. An expert elicitation is used to help rank their sensitivity to global warming and the uncertainty about the underlying physical mechanisms. Then we explain how, in principle, early warning systems could be established to detect the proximity of some tipping points.},

	Abstract = {Recurrence plots and recurrence quantification analysis have become popular in the last two decades. Recurrence based methods have on the one hand a deep foundation in the theory of dynamical systems and are on the other hand powerful tools for the investigation of a variety of problems. The increasing interest encompasses the growing risk of misuse and uncritical application of these methods. Therefore, we point out potential problems and pitfalls related to different aspects of the application of recurrence plots and recurrence quantification analysis.},

We use this entropy measure to quantitatively study in detail the phase synchronization of two bidirectionally coupled chaotic systems and identify different types of transitions to chaotic phase synchronization in dependence on the coupling strength and the frequency mismatch. By means of this analysis we find several new phenomena, such a chaos-period-chaos transition to phase synchronization for rather large coupling strengths.},

This is emphasized in a distorted main diagonal in the cross recurrence plot, the line of synchronization (LOS). A non-parametrical fit of this LOS can be used to rescale the time axis of the two data series (whereby one of them is compressed or stretched) so that they are synchronized. An application of this method to geophysical sediment core data illustrates its suitability for real data. The rock magnetic data of two different sediment cores from the Makarov Basin can be adjusted to each other by using this method, so that they are comparable.},

	Abstract = {Higher variability in rainfall and river discharge could be of major importance in landslide generation in the north-western Argentine Andes. Annual layered (varved) deposits of a landslide dammed lake in the Santa Maria Basin (26\&deg;S, 66\&deg;W) with an age of 30,000 <sup>14</sup>C years provide an archive of precipitation variability during this time. The comparison of these data with present-day rainfall observations tests the hypothesis that increased rainfall variability played a major role in landslide generation. A potential cause of such variability is the El Ni\&ntilde;o/ Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The causal link between ENSO and local rainfall is quantified by using a new method of nonlinear data analysis, the quantitative analysis of cross recurrence plots (CRP). This method seeks similarities in the dynamics of two different processes, such as an ocean-atmosphere oscillation and local rainfall. Our analysis reveals significant similarities in the statistics of both modern and palaeo-precipitation data. The similarities in the data suggest that an ENSO-like influence on local rainfall was present at around 30,000 <sup>14</sup>C years ago. Increased rainfall, which was inferred from a lake balance modeling in a previous study, together with ENSO-like cyclicities could help to explain the clustering of landslides at around 30,000 <sup>14</sup>C years ago.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we show that two dynamical invariants, the second order R{\'e}nyi entropy and the correlation dimension, can be estimated from recurrence plots (RPs) with arbitrary embedding dimension and delay. This fact is interesting as these quantities are even invariant if no embedding is used. This is an important advantage of RPs compared to other techniques of nonlinear data analysis. These estimates for the correlation dimension and entropy are robust and, moreover, can be obtained at a low numerical cost. We exemplify our results for the R{\"o}ssler system, the funnel attractor and the Mackey Glass system. In the last part of the paper we estimate dynamical invariants for data from some fluid dynamical experiments and confirm previous evidence for low dimensional chaos in this experimental system.},

	Abstract = {The knowledge of transitions between regular, laminar or chaotic behaviors is essential to understand the underlying mechanisms behind complex systems. While several linear approaches are often insufficient to describe such processes, there are several nonlinear methods that, however, require rather long time observations. To overcome these difficulties, we propose measures of complexity based on vertical structures in recurrence plots and apply them to the logistic map as well as to heart-rate-variability data. For the logistic map these measures enable us not only to detect transitions between chaotic and periodic states, but also to identify laminar states, i.e., chaos-chaos transitions. The traditional recurrence quantification analysis fails to detect the latter transitions. Applying our measures to the heart-rate-variability data, we are able to detect and quantify the laminar phases before a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia occurs thereby facilitating a prediction of such an event. Our findings could be of importance for the therapy of malignant cardiac arrhythmias.},

	Abstract = {In the analysis of coupled systems, various techniques have been developed to model and detect dependencies from observed bivariate time series. Most well-founded methods, like Granger-causality and partial coherence, are based on the theory of linear systems: on correlation functions, spectra and vector autoregressive processes. In this paper we discuss a nonlinear approach using recurrence.<br><br>Recurrence, which intuitively means the repeated occurrence of a very similar situation, is a basic notion in dynamical systems. The classical theorem of Poincar?e says that for every dynamical system with an invariant probability measure P, almost every point in a set B will eventually return to B. Moreover, for ergodic systems the mean recurrence time is 1/P(B). Details of recurrence patterns were studied when chaotic systems came into the focus of research, and it turned out that they are linked to Lyapunov exponents, generalized entropies, the correlation sum, and generalized dimensions.<br><br>Our goal here is to develop methods for time series which typically contain a few hundreds or thousands of values and which need not come from a stationary source. While Poincar\&eacute;'s theorem holds for stationary stochastic processes, and linear methods require stationarity at least for suficiently large windows, recurrence methods need less stationarity. We outline different concepts of recurrence by specifying different classes of sets B. Then we visualize recurrence and define recurrence parameters similar to autocorrelation.<br><br>We are going to apply recurrence to the analysis of bivariate data. The basic idea is that coupled systems show similar recurrence patterns. We can study joint recurrences as well as cross-recurrence. We shall see that bothapproaches have their benefits and drawbacks. <br><br>Model systems of coupled oscillators form a test bed for analysis of bivariate time series since the corresponding differential equations involve a parameter which precisely defines the degree of coupling. Changing the parameter we can switch to phase synchronization and generalized synchronization. The approaches of cross- and joint recurrence are compared for several models. In view of possible experimental requirements, recurrence is studied on ordinal scale as well as on metric scale. Several quantities for the description of synchronization are derived and illustrated. Finally, two different applications to EEG data will be presented.},

	Abstract = {We propose to look at first-return maps into a specified region of phase space as a basis for a unified renormalization scheme for dynamical systems. The choice of the region for first return is dictated by the symbolic dynamics (e.g., kneading sequence) of the relevant trajectories. The renormalization group can be formulated on the symbolic level, but once translated to maps it yields the said renormalization scheme. We show how the well-studied examples of the onset of chaos via period doubling and quasiperiodicity fit into this approach, and argue that these problems get in fact unified. The unification leads also to a generalization that allows us to study the onset of chaos in maps that belong to larger spaces of functions than those usually considered. In these maps we discover a host of new scenarios for the onset of chaos. These scenarios are physically relevant since the maps considered are reductions of simple flows. We present a theoretical analysis of some of these new scenarios, and report universal results. Finally we show that all the available renormalization groups can be found using symbolic manipulations only.},

	Abstract = {Recurrence is a fundamental property of dynamical systems, which can be exploited to characterise the system's behaviour in phase space. A powerful tool for their visualisation and analysis called recurrence plot was introduced in the late 1980's. This report is a comprehensive overview covering recurrence based methods and their applications with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the theory of recurrences, the basic idea of the recurrence plot with its variations is presented. This includes the quantification of recurrence plots, like the recurrence quantification analysis, which is highly effective to detect, e. g., transitions in the dynamics of systems from time series. A main point is how to link recurrences to dynamical invariants and unstable periodic orbits. This and further evidence suggest that recurrences contain all relevant information about a system's behaviour. As the respective phase spaces of two systems change due to coupling, recurrence plots allow studying and quantifying their interaction. This fact also provides us with a sensitive tool for the study of synchronisation of complex systems. In the last part of the report several applications of recurrence plots in economy, physiology, neuroscience, earth sciences, astrophysics and engineering are shown. The aim of this work is to provide the readers with the know how for the application of recurrence plot based methods in their own field of research. We therefore detail the analysis of data and indicate possible difficulties and pitfalls.},

	Abstract = {The identification of the coupling direction from measured time series taking place in a group of interacting components is an important challenge for many experimental studies. We propose here a method to uncover the coupling configuration by means of recurrence properties. The approach hinges on a generalization of conditional probability of recurrence, which was originally introduced to detect and quantify even weak coupling directions between two interacting systems, to the case of multivariate time series where indirect interactions might be present. We test our method by an example of three coupled Lorenz systems. Our results confirm that the proposed method has much potential to identify indirect coupling, which is very relevant for experimental time series analysis.},
