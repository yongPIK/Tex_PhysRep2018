\subsection{Nonlinear time series analysis}

A bit more on practical motivation - limitations of existing time series
analysis methods regarding certain common types of problems like detection of
subtle dynamical transitions, time-series reversibility tests, etc.? See comment
of Jonathan (added below at Discussion section)!

\subsection{Complex networks}

\subsection{Transformations from time series to network domain}
\cite{Donner2010NJP,marwan2007}

\subsection{Transformations of complex networks to time series(???)}
