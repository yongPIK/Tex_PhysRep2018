\section{Real-world applications {\bf{(All)}}}

RVD: My understanding of this section was rather that we collect information on all recent applications of the different methods, instead of focusing on one or two per method. Shouldn't we rather have a separate section highlighting some results for well-studied model systems (logistic map, R\"ossler, Lorenz, etc.) using all different methods, instead of having too detailed discussions of certain real-world examples?

(Update 15/02/17): I suggest splitting this section into two: (1) Numerical Examples, (2) Real-world applications. With that, we can easily proceed.

\subsection{Recurrence networks}
		\subsubsection{Example I: palaeoclimate data}
		\subsubsection{Example II: soil water }

	\subsection{Visibility graphs}
		\subsubsection{Example I: sunspot numbers}
		\subsubsection{Example II: Asymmetry of sunspots}

	\subsection{Transition networks}
	\subsection{Other approaches}

	%\subsection{{\color{red} Please suggest any examples you may find appropriately here. Later, we will agree upon 1 or 2 examples which will discussed in detail for each method and mention briefly about other examples. We will include those examples that have been fully done to avoid futher serious calculations. } }
