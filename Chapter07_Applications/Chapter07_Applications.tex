	\subsection{{\color{red} Please suggest any examples you may find
	appropriately here. Later, we will agree upon 1 or 2 examples which will
	discussed in detail for each method and mention briefly about other examples.
	We will include those examples that have been fully done to avoid futher
	serious calculations. } }
